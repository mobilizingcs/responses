# Responses Tool
A tool to view and manage ohmage 2.x survey responses

## ohmage Integration/Installation
This codebase is part of the suite of micro-frontend tools that now make up the web frontend clients for the [ohmage 2.x project](https://github.com/ohmage/server).  It assumes the use of the global [navbar](https://github.com/mobilizingcs/navbar) to handle login/logout/navigation. If you intend to host this project on your own ohmage server, please serve the navbar from `/` (root) and place this tool's code inside a directory relative to the root: `/webapps/{tool}` (some apps assume an legacy nomenclature: `/navbar/{tool}).
